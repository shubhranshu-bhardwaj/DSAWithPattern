Key Indicators for Using Two Pointers:

Sorted Arrays/Lists: The array or list is sorted, and you need to search or compare elements.

Subarray Problems: You need to find or check properties of a subarray (e.g., sum, product, length).

Pairs/Triplets: You're looking for pairs or triplets that satisfy a certain condition.

Partitioning: You need to partition an array into different categories based on certain conditions.

Comparison Across Both Ends: You're comparing elements from both ends of the data structure (like palindrome checking).
